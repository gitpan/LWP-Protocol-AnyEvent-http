=head1 NAME

LWP::Protocol::AnyEvent::http - Event loop friendly HTTP and HTTPS backend for LWP


=head1 VERSION

Version 1.0.2


=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # Make HTTP and HTTPS requests friendly to event loops.
    use LWP::Protocol::AnyEvent::http;

    # Or LWP::Simple, WWW::Mechanize, etc
    use LWP::UserAgent;

    # A reason to want LWP friendly to event loops.
    use Coro qw( async );

    my $ua = LWP::UserAgent->new();
    $ua->protocols_allowed([qw( http https )]);  # Playing it safe.

    for my $url (@urls) {
        async { process( $ua->get($url) ) };
    }


=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<LWP> performs a number of blocking calls when trying
to process requests. This makes it unfriendly to event-driven
systems and cooperative multitasking system such as L<Coro>.

This module makes LWP more friendly to these systems
by plugging in an HTTP and HTTPS protocol implementor
powered by L<AnyEvent> and L<AnyEvent::HTTP>.

This module is known to work with L<Coro>. Please let
me (C<< <ikegami@adaelis.com> >>) know where else this
is of use so I can add tests and add a mention.

All LWP features and configuration options should still be
available when using this module.

=item * L<LWP::Protocol::Coro::http>

An earlier implementation of this module that requires L<Coro>.
These two modules are developed in parallel.

=item * L<Coro>

An excellent cooperative multitasking library assisted by this module.

=item * L<AnyEvent>, L<AnyEvent::HTTP>

Powers this module.

=item * L<LWP::Simple>, L<LWP::UserAgent>, L<WWW::Mechanize>

Affected by this module.

=item * L<Coro::LWP>

An alternative to this module for users of L<Coro>. Intrusive, which results
in problems in some unrelated code. Doesn't support HTTPS. Supports FTP and NTTP.

=item * L<AnyEvent::HTTP::LWP::UserAgent>

An alternative to this module. Doesn't help code that uses L<LWP::Simple> or L<LWP::UserAgent> directly.

I haven't gotten around to implementing proxy support.
